# Allyson's Work Schedule

# Description

This website is a challenge for bootcamp that allows a user to write down a typical workday schedule that is interactive based on time. The time blocks will change color depending on the time of day, with grey meaning past, red meaning present, and green meaning future. The information written in the text boxes can be saved using the blue save buttons to the side of the text box.
